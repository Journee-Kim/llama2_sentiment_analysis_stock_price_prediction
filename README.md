Improving Stock Price Prediction Accuracy with PEFT-fine-tuned LLaMA Sentiment Analysis
For sentiment analysis, this research will utilize the LLaMA2 7b model. Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) is an open-source LLM released by Meta. LLaMA2, released in July 2023 (Touvron et al., 2023), consists of a family of large language models (LLMs) ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters, both pre-trained and fine-tuned (Buscemi and Proverbio, 2024). This research delves into the potential of the LLaMA2 model to address the challenges in sentiment analysis, particularly in effectively handling the nuances and ambiguities inherent in natural language.
However, as noted by Jeong (2024), fine-tuning the entire LLaMA model can be computationally expensive. Studies have shown that fine-tuning the entire model doesn't significantly improve performance. This has led to the adoption of Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. These techniques focus on modifying only a small subset of the model's weights, while keeping the rest frozen for efficiency (Mao et al., 2022). Therefore, this research will propose an advanced stock price prediction model that utilizes sentiment analysis with a fine-tuned LLaMA2 model.
